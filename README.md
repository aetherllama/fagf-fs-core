# FAGF-FS: Foundational Agentic Governance Framework for Financial Services

This repository is the home of the **Foundational Agentic Governance Framework for Financial Services (FAGF-FS)**—a standardized specification for the safe deployment of autonomous AI agents in financial ecosystems.

## 📖 The Specification
The core of this repository is the [FAGF-FS Specification](./SPECIFICATION.md). 

FAGF-FS provides:
- **Architectural Blueprints**: Tiered Validation Logic (TVL) and Sync/Async integration patterns.
- **Mandate Taxonomy**: Standardized categories for Authorization, Spending, Velocity, and Reasoning.
- **AI-Specific Safety**: Protocols for Reasoning Consistency and Hallucination Filtering.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Templates for mapping to MAS, ISO 20022, and other foundational standards.

## 🚀 Supporting Reference Implementation
To demonstrate the practical utility of the framework, this repository includes a **Sample Application**—a high-fidelity demo of the FAGF-FS "Validator" in action.

### Features
- **Deterministic Validator**: A reference TypeScript implementation of the FAGF-FS core engine.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A premium UI to simulate agent transactions and experience the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) flow.
- **Live Audit Trace**: Full observability into how mandates are evaluated and enforced.

## 🛠 Getting Started (Sample App)
To explore the reference implementation locally:

1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. `npm run dev`
